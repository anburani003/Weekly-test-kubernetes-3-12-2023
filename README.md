# Weekly-test-kubernetes-3-12-2023

Perform the three test cases described:

Test Case 1: Successful Deployment
Execute the deployment script and verify that all microservices are deployed without errors. Check that pods are running, and services are accessible.

Test Case 2: Rolling Deployment Validation
Initiate a new release using the deployment script and monitor the rolling deployment of the backend microservice. Confirm that the application remains accessible and responsive throughout the deployment.

Test Case 3: Ingress Configuration
Access the application externally through the configured Ingress resource. Confirm that the frontend microservice is reachable and functions correctly through the Ingress.
